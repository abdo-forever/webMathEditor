This project is abandoned in favor of MathJax editor due to extremely poor support of MathML by web browsers. 
Also, Firefox (the only browser where this worked) introduced some changes in v20 that broke this code.

webMathEditor is a javascript addon, that enables seamless interactivity of MathML markup. 

Features:
1) Recognizing mouseclicks and rendering a mockup of a blinking cursor
2) Accepting typed input: space, letters, simple arithmetic operations ([+]/[-]/[*]/[/]/[^])
3) Backspace erases complete templates
4) Keyborad navigation with left and right arrow keys

TODO
1) Complete keyboard navigation with [Enter]/[Tab]/[Arrows]/[Ctrl-Arrows][Shift-Tab]/[Ctrl-Enter] etc
2) Introduce customizable shortcuts, e.g. [Ctrl-2] for square root
3) Template insertion with GUI buttons, customizable buttons
4) Customizable list of recognizabl functions, e.g. sin cos tan exp log etc
5) May be accept LaTEX commands, such as \frac \sqrt etc
